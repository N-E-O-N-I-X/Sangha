<i>Thus is he 'the Blessed One' : he is worthy; he is perfectly enlightened; he is perfected in wisdom and ethics; he is the Well-Farer; he is a knower of the worlds; he is the unrivaled guide of those who can be tamed; he is the teacher of gods & men; he is enlightened; and he is blessed.</i>

  <h2><u>Basic Information</u></h2>
  <p>
  This chant is found frequently throughout the Pāli Canon, in many different contexts; using SuttaCentral, I found at least 161 instances of the gāthā! The verse is, ultimately, a list of nine qualities for which the Buddha should be celebrated. Beyond the canon, the chant is featured in elaborative texts that expand on each of the nine qualities, as well as in magical "yantra" designs which abbreviate the Buddha's nine virtues into nine initial characters.

  <h2><u>In the Suttas</u></h2>
  <h3><i><u>The Buddha's Reputation</u></i></h3>
  <p>
  The formula commonly appears as a simple piece of dialogue in stories involving people who had learned about the Buddha’s arrival at some place. In these texts (ex: AN 3.63), word of the Buddha being nearby would have reached an individual or a crowd, and along with that news would come discussions of the Buddha’s reputation, expressed using the pericope of his nine virtues. Often, this serves as a narrative device to introduce people involved in the body of the text, who usually felt inspired to go and visit the Buddha, establishing the occasion for that particular sermon. This context is quite common throughout the Pāli Canon, though more doctrinally-significant instances of the formula relate to the idea of faith.
  </p>
  <h3><i><u>Faith in the Buddha's Enlightenment</u></i></h3>
  <h4><u>Definition of Terms</u></h4>
  <p>
  Looking at texts that feature this formula, we find several Pāli terms that can be translated into English as “faith,” but doing so necessitates stripping the English word of some of its implications, followed by a reintroduction of some nuances lost from the Pāli words in translation.
  </p>
  <p>
  In English, the word “faith” sometimes suggests the acceptance of a principle in the absence of evidence. In Pāli, this specific sense requires the adjective “amūlikā,” as in “amūlikā saddhā” - “saddhā” being a word for “faith,” with “amūlikā” literally meaning “without root,” or “groundless, unfounded.” In the Canki Sutta (MN 95), the Buddha criticized the Brahmin priests for their “amūlikā saddhā,” since they claimed that the Vedas alone were true, despite the fact that not one single Brahmin could rightly claim to have reached that belief through direct experience, instead relying on merely “chanting what has been chanted before and teaching what has been taught before.”
  </p>
  <p>
  In Buddhist texts, the idea of “faith” carries an additional connotation: confidence, a conviction gained only through the direct experience which the Brahmins lacked. This sense is generally conveyed even in the basic term “saddhā,” but it can be emphasized with an adjective, as in “ākaravati saddhā,” with “ākaravati” literally meaning “having the quality of method,” or in simpler terms, “supported with good reason.”
  </p>
  <p>
  This phrase appears in the Vīmamsaka Sutta (MN 47), which records a guideline the Buddha established for his disciples to test him and see for themselves that he was authentically enlightened. In short, the Buddha recommended that monks diligently observe him for an extended period of time in order to examine his behavior - doing so, he assured, would convince them of his ethical purity. He further encouraged monks, after this period of observation, to come and question him directly. Next, he said that monks should learn his teachings, because once they understood some aspect of the doctrine “with direct experiential knowledge” (abhiññāya), they would finally have “confidence in the teacher” (satthari pasīdati). Then, and only then, could a disciple be said to possess “ākaravati saddhā,” which we may now render in English as “faith supported by evidence.”
  </p>
  <p>
  This is the context which must be understood when we see the ”itipi so” formula connected to the idea of faith. It’s not a mere acceptance that the Buddha possessed these nine qualities; it’s a confidence in that fact! This is why, in the Dutiyasaranānisakka Sutta (SN 55.25), someone who declared that the Buddha possessed these characteristics was described as “having complete confidence in the Buddha” (buddhe ekantagato hoti abhippasanno).
  </p>
  <p>
  Of course, some 2,500 years later, we cannot observe his behavior or sit down with him to question him. What we can do is investigate the teachings he left behind, begin walking the path he laid out, and see for ourselves what has been achieved by the sangha. In fact, we often see two accompanying formulas alongside the gāthā of the Buddha’s nine virtues: one for faith in the Dhamma, and another for faith in the sangha. Just as one may have “absolute confidence” (aveccappasādena) in the Buddha’s enlightenment, and his possession of the nine virtues, one may also have the same faith in the teachings, which are “open to investigation” (ehipassiko) so that sensible people can discern for themselves (paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhī) their authenticity. Likewise, we may have faith in the sangha for their dedication to those teachings. In seeing the benefits of the teaching he left behind, those of us in the modern day may still develop a faith in the Buddha.
  </p>
  <h4><u>The Importance of Faith</u></h4>
  <p>
  The suttas make clear the importance of faith in the Buddha. Immediately after becoming enlightened and resolving to teach the Dhamma, the Buddha declared "Open, now, is the door to the deathless! May those who can hear commit to faith!" (MN 26). It is celebrated as "the treasure of faith" (saddhādhana), one of several qualities to which the wise should devote themselves (AN 5.47). When the devout layman Citta was dying, his loved ones asked him for guidance before he passed; with his parting words, he encouraged them to develop "absolute confidence" (aveccappasādena) in the Buddha (represented with the formula of his nine virtues), the Dhamma, and the Sangha, in addition to practicing generosity by making offerings to the virtuous (SN 41.10).
  </p>
  <p><u>Faith is Fundamental to the Religious Path</u></p>
  <p>
  Faith is especially important in the role it plays at the beginning of one's religious training. It is the first of the five "factors of effort" (padhāniyangāni) which a disciple must possess if they wish to reach the goal. The Buddha called his religious path the "gradual training" (anupubbasikkhā), the first stage of which involves "someone in whom faith has arisen" (saddhājāto) approaching a teacher (MN 70). That term literally means "faith-born," which better conveys the transformative power of this confident devotion which kickstarts one's religious journey. Similarly, the Buddha placed faith at the beginning of a sequence which culminates in "attaining the truth" (MN 95). He discussed monks as having "gone out of faith from the lay life to homelessness" (saddhā agārasmā anagāriyam pabbajito hoti) (MN 29). Faith is just as important for lay disciples, as well, as we see in the Buddha's advice to his fellow Sakyan, Mahānāma: his countryman asked for advice suitable for laymen, and the Buddha responded with a different presentation of the "factors of effort," beginning with the declaration that "truly, the faithful succeed, Mahānāma, not the faithless" (saddho kho, mahānāma, ārādhako hoti, no assaddho) (AN 11.11).
  </p>
  <p>
  The Buddha sometimes discussed the stages of religious development using lists of "types of persons." One of the more common lists is a sevenfold scheme that classifies disciples based on the primary quality they rely on as they progress towards enlightenment. In this scheme, two of the seven classes are distinguished by primarily relying on faith (saddhā).
  </p>

  FAITH ALONE IS CONSIDERABLE
  In a conversation with Prince Bodhi of Bhagga (MN 85), the Buddha demonstrated the importance of these factors by asking the prince - renowned for his skill in using a tool called a "goad" while riding elephants - if he, himself, would be able to instruct an apprentice in the art of elephant-goading if that apprentice was faithless, or likewise possessed qualities which are the opposites of the factors of effort. The prince responded that he would be unable to train an apprentice that had just one of those bad qualities -

  NOT JUST A BEGINNING THING!!!! IT'S IMPORTANT ALL THE WHILE!!! "indispensible part of a disciple's spiritual arsenal"
  <p>
  A disciple's faith in the Buddha's enlightenment is likened to a fortress - "with faith as a pillar" (saddhesiko), one gives up unskillful qualities in favor of skillful ones and keeps themselves pure, safeguarding them from harm (AN 7.67).
