<h2><a href="4nt.html"><strong>The Four Noble Truths</strong></a></h2>
The Buddha's most important teaching, with plenty of background information.
<h2><a href="chart.jpg"><strong>Visual Aid - Sensory Process Chart</strong></a></h2>
A visual aid to accompany "The Four Noble Truths," roughly demonstrating the sensory process which is central to the Buddha's teachings.
<h2><a href="rebirth.html"><strong>Rebirth & Kamma</strong></a></h2>
An essay about rebirth and kamma (or "karma" in Sanskrit).
<h2><a href="cosmos.html"><strong>Cosmology</strong></a></h2>
A series of essays exploring the Buddhist cosmos, as well as the various beings who live, die, and get reborn in it. [WORK IN PROGRESS!]
<h2><a href="real.html"><strong>Heaven is For Real</strong></a></h2>
A presentation of counter-arguments to claims made by Piya Tan, in which he suggests that the Buddha only spoke about heaven, hell, and gods as metaphors or cultural conventions. I argue that the early Buddhist texts clearly assume the literal reality of such things.
<h2><a href="mahapurisa.html"><strong>Notes on the MahƒÅpurisa, the 32 Marks, and the Cakkavatti</strong></a></h2>
A deep-dive into three overlapping ideas found in the Buddhist texts: the prophecy of the Great Man, the marks found on his body, and the Holy King.
