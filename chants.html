  <h1>Chants</h1>

<h2><a href="earlychanting.html"><strong>Background Information</strong></a></h2>
A brief overview of the role chanting seems to have played in the early Buddhist community.
<h2><a href="namo.html"><strong>Namakāra Udāna</strong></a></h2>
"The Expression of Reverence" - often called the "namo tassa" chant, after its first two words. This is one of the most common and basic chants.
<h2><a href="itipiso.html"><strong>The Gāthā of the Buddha's Nine Virtues</strong></a></h2>
This formula lists nine qualities for which the Buddha should be celebrated. It is often called the "itipi so" chant, after the first two words which precede the list.
<h2><a href="dust.html"><strong>The Dustcloth Recitation</strong></a></h2>
A personal favorite of mine: this may well be the simplest Buddhist practice, though it comes from the commentarial tradition, and not the early texts.

<i>Disclaimer!
<br>Regarding the audio clips provided in the above pages: these are my own recordings, and it should be said that my pronunciation of Pāli is imperfect, especially aspirated syllables like the "dh" in "dhamma," which is supposed to sound a bit more "breathy" than I typically vocalize.
<br>Furthermore, the rhythm, tone, etc. is my own approximation of specific versions performed by more traditional, authoritative reciters. If you have the great fortune to practice with a community in real life, they may perform these chants in their own ways, likely as parts of longer ritual recitations; simply follow their lead!</i>
